# WeRateDogs Twitter Archive: Data Wrangling and Analysis

This project focuses on wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing the WeRateDogs Twitter archive. WeRateDogs is a popular Twitter account that humorously rates people's dogs. The dataset contains over 5000 tweets, providing valuable insights into the account's activity and the characteristics of the rated dogs.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to clean the provided dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover interesting trends and patterns. The project is divided into several key steps:

1. **Data Gathering**: 
    - Collecting data from various sources, including a CSV file, TSV file, and API.
    
2. **Data Assessment**: 
    - Assessing the quality and structure of the dataset to identify issues related to completeness, consistency, and accuracy.
    
3. **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Cleaning the data by addressing missing values, correcting data types, and fixing any identified issues.
    
4. **Data Storage**: 
    - Storing the cleaned dataset for further analysis.
    
5. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: 
    - Analyzing the cleaned dataset to uncover insights, and visualizing these insights using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

6. **Reporting**:
    - Documenting the entire process in a Jupyter Notebook, including data gathering, assessment, cleaning, and the analysis findings.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Core programming language used for the project.
- **Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical computations.
- **Requests**: Library for handling API requests.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Platform used for documenting the analysis process.

## Key Insights

The analysis provides insights into the following:
- The distribution of ratings given by WeRateDogs.
- Trends in tweet frequency over time.
- Relationships between tweet metrics (favorites, retweets) and dog ratings.
